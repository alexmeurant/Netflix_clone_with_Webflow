# Netflix_clone_with_Webflow
A glimpse of the potential of ``Webflow`` by creating a Netflix clone.

In this project, I discovered the basics of webflow, namely:

- How to ``structure`` a page (section, block, ...)
- How to ``interact`` with the elements (transformation, links, ...)
- How to ``administer a database`` and use it to display information (CMS).
